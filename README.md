**Ormera Core** is the heart of the Ormera project. It includes the DSL parser and AST generator for the custom domain-specific language (DSL) used to define models, relationships, and data types.

## Features
- Custom DSL parser to convert schema definitions into an abstract syntax tree (AST).
- Written in TypeScript for strong type safety.
- Supports primary keys, foreign keys, relationships, and field attributes like `unique` and `nullable`.

## Installation
```bash
npm install ormera-core
